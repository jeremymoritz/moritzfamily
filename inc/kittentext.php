  2	=>	"<p>Once upon a time, there was a beautiful young damsel named Penelope Precious who lived all alone with her baby kitten Floofy.</p>",
  3	=>	"<p>One dark and scary day, as Penelope sorted through her mail, she came across something dreadful.  It was a letter from Floofy.  &quot;Help!&quot; read the letter, &quot;Lost in woods!  Please bring food!&quot;</p>",
  4	=>	"<p>This was a calamitous happening indeed.  Penelope had to do something.  So, she packed up a basket of goodies and courageously skipped to the woods.</p>",
  5	=>	"<p>Penelope looked high and low, around this tree and that tree.  &quot;Where could he be?&quot; poor Penelope wondered.  &quot;I must find my kitten!&quot;</p>",
  6	=>	"<p>The deeper Penelope searched into the woods, the scarier they became.  At one point, she was even chased by a bear!</p>",
  7	=>	"<p>Just as Penelope had almost given up hope, she looked in the distance and there was her beloved kitten!  &quot;I found you!&quot; exclaimed Penelope.</p>
        <p>&quot;Meow,&quot; said Floofy.</p>",
  8	=>	"<p>But just before Penelope could pick him up, out from behind the tree popped the mischievous Dr. Dreadful!</p>
        <p>&quot;Hee hee hee!&quot; the old doctor snickered, &quot;You have fallen for my little scheme.  It was I who wrote the letter!  This cat can't even hold a pencil!  Now hand over that basket of goodies or you will not see your precious kitten ever again!&quot;</p>",
  9	=>	"<p>&quot;No!&quot; shouted Penelope, angrily clutching the basket, &quot;You can't keep Floofy.  He's my cat!&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;Very well,&quot; sneered Dr. Dreadful, &quot;Then I will tie you up!&quot; And without another word, the roguish doctor wrapped a thick rope around Penelope Precious.</p>",
  10	=>	"<p>It seemed as if there were no hope for the distressed damsel.  But Penelope didn't give up.  &quot;Run!&quot; she shouted to Floofy, &quot;Find someone to rescue me!&quot;  And Floofy bounded away and escaped the woods in search of help.</p>",
  11	=>	"<p>Not far away, Floofy discovered a strapping young lad named Nicolas Niceguy helping an old lady cross the street.  &quot;Meow,&quot; thought Floofy.</p>",
  12	=>	"<p>As soon as Nicolas Niceguy learned of the imminent danger about to befall Penelope Precious, he scooped Floofy into his arms and raced to the woods to rescue her.</p>",
  13	=>	"<p>Floofy could not remember the way back, so together they searched high and low, around this tree and that tree.  At one point, they were even chased by a bear!</p>",
  14	=>	"<p>Just as Floofy was about to give up all hope of finding his beloved master, the dynamic duo saw a golden brown horse in the distance.  It was a nice horse, but even more significant was the woman sitting atop its back.  Why it was none other than Penelope Precious tied head to toe and in much distress!</p>
        <p>&quot;Meow&quot; cried Floofy as the two raced to her side.</p>",
  15	=>	"<p class='smaller'>But just before reaching the damsel, the naughty Dr. Dreadful appeared and stopped them in their tracks.  &quot;Where do you think you're going?&quot; scorned the ill-behaved doctor.</p>
        <p class='smaller'>&quot;I'm trying to save that poor, defenseless damsel in distress!&quot; exclaimed Nicolas Niceguy.</p>
        <p class='smaller'>&quot;Oh no you don't!&quot; Dr. Dreadful replied.  &quot;I tricked her fair and square.  You just run along and mind your own business!&quot;</p>
        <p class='smaller'>Nicolas and Floofy could tell that Dr. Dreadful was up to no good.  &quot;Can't we talk this over like civilized folk?&quot;</p>",
  16	=>	"<p>&quot;No!&quot; said the doctor.  And with that he punched the valiant man square in the face.  &quot;You have meddled in my affair long enough, I say!&quot;</p>",
  17	=>	"<p>Then Dr. Dreadful, who incidentally is not even a real doctor, grabbed Nicolas by the throat.  &quot;Now, you will wish you had never chosen the path of bravery and kindness.  No more Mr. Niceguy!  Ha! Ha! Ha!</p>",
  18	=>	"<p>But Nicolas did not give up.  He gathered all of his strength and gave Dr. Dreadful a walloping punch in the jaw.</p>",
  19	=>	"<p>The underhanded doctor, realizing he was outmatched in strength pulled out a powerful weapon.  &quot;You're no match for me now!&quot; laughed Dr. Dreadful.  &quot;You might as well give up!&quot;</p>",
  20	=>	"<p>&quot;Never!&quot; shouted Nicolas Niceguy.  And with a swift kick, he whacked the weapon high into the air and snatched it away from the villainous doctor.  &quot;Who's giving up now?&quot; asked Nicolas.  It was a rhetorical question.</p>",
  21	=>	"<p>&quot;I am!&quot; sobbed the defeated doctor as he dropped to his knees in surrender.</p>",
  22	=>	"<p>While Floofy kept a close eye on Dr. Dreadful, Nicolas Niceguy untied the adorable maiden.</p>
        <p>&quot;Thank you,&quot; sighed Penelope.</p>
        <p>&quot;You're welcome,&quot; said Nicolas.  After stepping down from his box, he turned to the now-not-so-dreadful Dr. Dreadful.  &quot;And as for you,&quot; he bravely asserted, &quot;I know just the place for your type.&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;The candy store?&quot; Dr. Dreadful pleaded.</p>",
  23	=>	"<p>&quot;Nope!  You're going straight to jail!&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;Curses!&quot; the old doctor bellowed, &quot;Foiled again!&quot;</p>",
  24	=>	"<p>With Dr. Dreadful safely behind bars, Nicolas Niceguy treated Penelope Precious to a root beer float at the local soda shop.</p>
        <p>&quot;Will you marry me?&quot; Nicolas asked between slurps of root beer.</p>
        <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; answered Penelope.</p>",
  25	=>	"<p>Three days later, they were married and went on to live happily ever after.</p>
        <p id='thend'>THE END</p>"
